Feature: Access to Employee Profile
As a system administrator, I want to restrict profile access by role so that sensitive data is protected and only authorized users can make changes

Scenario: Access own profile
    Given the user is logged in as "Employee"
    And the user is on the "Employee Management - Profile" page
    Then the user's own employee profile should be displayed

Scenario: Unauthorized access blocked
    Given the user is logged in as "User"
    And the user is on the "Employee Management - Profile" page
    When the user attempts to access the profile of another employee
    Then the message "You do not have permission to access this profile." should be displayed

Scenario: Project manager access to subordinates
    Given the user is logged in as "Project Manager"
    And the user is on the "Employee Management - Profile" page
    When the user navigates to the profile of a subordinate employee
    Then the subordinate employee's profile should be displayed
    When the user attempts to access the profile of an employee outside their reporting structure
    Then the message "You do not have permission to access this profile." should be displayed

Scenario: Project manager restricted from outside structure
    Given the user is logged in as "Project Manager"
    And the user is on the "Employee Management - Profile" page
    When the user attempts to access the profile of an employee outside their reporting structure
    Then the page should display the text "You do not have permission to access this profile."‚Äù

Scenario: HR staff access to all profiles
    Given the user is logged in as "HR Staff"
    And the user is on the "Employee Management - Profile" page
    When the user navigates to the profile of any employee
    Then the employee's profile should be displayed
